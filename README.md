# Games Database

## What is it?
This is a mini project to look at Cockroach DB using Spring JDBC, as well as an accompanying UI using React. That project can 
be found [here](https://github.com/chrisp1985/games-frontend). Cockroach isn't really needed for this as the consistency isn't
particularly important, but I wanted to dockerise it and understand how data is made highly available so there are multi- and 
single-cluster node setups in the docker directory.

## CockroachDB
CockroachDB offers high available and strong consistency by using the raft consensus algorithm. In the docker files, I have a
multi-cluster setup which aims to achieve consensus on changes made to the database, as well as a single-cluster model.

### Docker Compose
To run the database, just run `docker-compose up` on either of the docker-compose files in docker/cockroachdb.

The CockroachDB UI can be accessed at http://localhost:8080, while the database itself can be accessed through DBeaver or some
other SQL app via http://localhost:26527/gamesdb.

The Database is created using the script in the docker-compose file.

The UI shows some interesting stuff about usage, where the data is split etc.

## Flyway
Flyway creates the data in the database on startup. The first script creates the tables, the second populates them.

## MapStruct
### Notes
- To use Mapstruct, it has to go _after_ the implementation of lombok (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64689460/mapstruct-mapper-returns-empty-mapped-object).

### How it's used
Run the `./gradlew clean build`, and the build directory will be populated with the mapper.

### Testcontainers support

This project uses [Testcontainers at development time](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.4.5/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.testcontainers).

Testcontainers has been configured to use the following Docker images:

* [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.
